# Codeclan Week 03 Day 03
## Ruby, Databases, SQL and One to Many relationships
### Music Collection Lab/Homework

For this lab you're asked to simulate a music collection database.
In particular we're performing CRUD actions on a DB whose tables contain one to many relationships.

## Notes

* Again, don't rush. A slip of the comma and you're without a paddle.
* Note that these are one to many interactions - artist may have many albums (for this scenario)
* Be sure to use prepared statetments to prevent SQL injections
* 

## Files
* console.rb - runner file which executes the CRUD actions
* music_collection.sql - contains the SQL needed to create the tables and schema for music_collection DB
* sql_runner.rb - contains the ruby commands for postgres DB interaction - saves recycling them with every CRUD command.
* albums.rb - Ruby file containing methods for handling album table
* artists.rb - Ruby file containing methods for handling artists table
